Dripline Library
================

The "end-user" aspects of the dripline-cpp API can be divided into core dripline implementations:

* :ref:`Agent<agent>`: sends messages (primarily used by the :ref:`agent`)
* :ref:`Endpoint<endpoint>`: receives messages and acts on them
* :ref:`Service<service>`: primary connection with the broker; can have child endpoints and is an endpoint itself
* :ref:`Messages<messages>`: concrete implementations of the request, reply, and alert message concepts

and useful extensions:

* :ref:`Hub<hub>`: service that dispatches requests to C++ functions (or function-like objects)
* :ref:`Monitor<monitor>`: listens to messages on a mesh (primarily used by the :ref:`monitor`)
* :ref:`Relayer<relayer>`: asynchronously sends messages

There are also a number of classes that implement various features of the above classes:

* :ref:`Core<core>`: interface for the RabbitMQ client library; interface includes interacting with the broker and for sending and receiving messages
* :ref:`Heartbeater<heartbeater>`: implements the heartbeat behavior
* :ref:`Listeners<listeners>`: listen for AMQP messages (dripline message chunks or whole messages)
* :ref:`Receivers<receivers>`: collect dripline message chunks and assembles them into complete messages
* :ref:`Scheduler<scheduler>`: executes scheduled events
* :ref:`Specifier<specifier>`: parses specifier strings
* :ref:`Version Store<version-store>`: stores version information for a particular application context


Core Behavior
=============

.. _agent:

Agent
-----

An ``agent`` takes command-line arguments and sends messages accordingly.  It is primarily used 
for the :ref:`dl-agent` application.

.. _endpoint:

Endpoint
--------

The ``endpoint`` is the basic dripline object capable of handling requests.  

An implementation of a particular endpoint should be a class that inherits from ``endpoint``.

.. _service:

Service
-------

The ``service`` class implements the fundamental "service" concept in dripline: 
it's the basic work unit in a dripline mesh.  It maintains the connection to the broker 
that's used by one or more endpoints, and it is itself an endpoint.

It's range of capabilities are largely defined by the classes it inherits from:

* ``core``
* ``endpoint``
* ``listener_receiver``
* ``heartbeater``
* ``scheduler``

The interface for running a service consists of three functions:

* ``start()``
* ``listen()`` (blocking)
* ``stop()``

A service can have both synchronous and asynchronous child endpoints.  With the former, requests are 
handled synchronously with the recieving of messages and with processing messages bound for itself.  
With the latter, requests are passed to the appropriate endpoint, which handles them in its own thread.

.. _messages:

Messages
--------

The message classes encapsulate the information in dripline messages as C++ objects.

The set of classes comprise the base class, ``message``, and the concrete classes ``msg_alert``,
``msg_reply``, and ``msg_request``.

Message objects know how to convert between themselves and AMQP message objects.


Useful Extensions
=================

.. _hub:

Hub
---

A hub is a service that is setup to receive requests and maps specifiers to C++ handler functions.  
This allows you to, for example, receive requests intended for a variety of destinations within 
a single application and have the requests distributed accordingly.

.. _monitor:

Monitor
-------

A ``monitor`` listens for messages sent to a particular set of keys and prints them to the terminal.

It is used primarily for the :ref:`dl-mon` application.

.. _relayer:

Relayer
-------

A ``relayer`` allows a user to asynchronously send messages.  Replies can be waited on in a thread-safe way 
(either in the user's thread or by setting up a thread to wait and then do something once it arrives) 
or ignored.


Other Classes
=============

.. _core:

Core
----

The ``core`` class provides an interface for the basic AMQP functionality.  It wraps the 
more general RabbitMQ API in a dripline-specific interface.

The class includes a number of static utility functions for interacting with the broker.

It further includes a complete interface for sending messages.

.. _heartbeater:

Heartbeater
-----------

The ``heartbeater`` class is used by ``service`` or any other client code 
to repeatedly sends a heartbeat on a particular time interval.

The heartbeat is an alert sent to a pre-determined routing key, which is given as a parameter to the 
``execute()`` function.  The interval for sending the heartbeats is ``f_heartbeat_interval_s``, 
which is in seconds.  The default interval is 60 s.

.. _listeners:

Listeners
---------

A listener is a class capable of listening on an AMQP channel for AMQP messages, 
which represent either a dripline message chunk or an entire dripline message.  
The ``listener`` class provides the basic framework for doing that.

The typical use case involves at least two threads:
1. A listener gets messages from the AMQP channel (using ``listen_on_queue()``, 
    e.g. ``service`` or ``endpoint_listener_receiver``) and 
    calls ``receiver::handle_message_chunk()``
2. A receiver has a timing thread waiting for multiple message chunks (if relevant); 
    when the message is complete, ``receiver::process_message()`` is called.

``listener_receiver`` is a convenience class that brings together ``listener`` and ``concurrent_receiver``.

``endpoint_listener_receiver`` is a decorator class for a "plain" endpoint: 
it adds ``listener_receiver`` capabilities, allowing it to act as an asynchronous endpoint of a ``service``.

.. _receivers:

Receivers
---------

A receiver is able to collect Dripline message chunks and reassemble them into a complete dripline message.

Dripline messages can be broken up into multiple chunks, each of which is transported as an AMQP message.  
A receiver is responsible for handling message chunks, storing incomplete dripline messages, and eventually 
processing complete dripline messages.

The ``receiver`` class contains an interface specifically for users waiting to receive reply messages: `wait_for_reply()`.

The ``concurrent_receiver`` class allows client code to concurrently receive and process messages 
(i.e. in separate threads).  

.. _scheduler:

Scheduler
---------

The ``scheduler`` executes scheduled events.  
An event is an executable object (e.g. a std::function object, or a lambda) 
with the signature `void ()`.

Events can be one-off, scheduled for a particular time, or they can be repeating, 
scheduled with an interval starting at a particular time.  The default start time for 
repeating events is "now."

.. _specifier:

Specifier
---------

Message specifier strings of the form ``"my.favorite.command"`` are tokenized 
into an array of strings: ``["my", "favorite", "command"]``.

.. _version-store:

Version Store
-------------

The ``version_store`` is a singleton class to store all version information relevant in any particular context.
