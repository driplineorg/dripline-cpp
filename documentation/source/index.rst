Dripline-cpp Use and API Documentation
======================================

Dripline-cpp has three main components: 
a command-line application for sending dripline messages, ``dl-agent``, 
a command-line application for monitoring dripline messages, ``dl-mon``,
and the library, which allows you to build dripline-enabled applications.

Note that the documentation on this dripline-cpp site pertain specifically 
to dripline-cpp.  Derived or unrelated implementations may differ in ways 
that aren't subject to the dripline standards.  This is particularly true 
for the user interface.
