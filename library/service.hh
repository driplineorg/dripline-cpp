     @brief Consumer of Dripline messages on a particular queue

     @details
     The service class is the implementation of the "service" concept in Dripline.
     It's the primary component that makes up a Dripline mesh.

     The lifetime of a service is defined by the three main functions:
       1. `start()` -- create the AMQP channel, create the AMQP queue, bind the routing keys, and start consuming AMQP messages
       2. `listen()` -- starts the heartbeat and scheduler threads (optional), starts the receiver thread, and waits for and handles messages on the queue
       3. `stop()` -- (called asynchronously) cancels the listening service

     The ability to handle and respond to Dripline messages is embodied in the `endpoint` class.  
     Service uses `endoint` in three ways:
       1. Service is an endpoint.  A service can be setup to handle messages directed to it.
       2. Service has basic child endpoints.  These are also called "synchronous" endpoints.  
          These endpoints use the same AMQP queue as the service itself.  Messages send to the 
          service and to the synchronous endpoints are all handled serially.
       3. Service has asynchronous child endpoints.  These endpoints each have their own AMQP 
          queue and thread responsible for receiving and handling their messages.

     A service has a number of key characteristics (most of which come from its parent classes):
       * `core` -- Has all of the basic AMQP capabilities, sending messages, and making and manipulating connections
       * `endpoint` -- Handles Dripline messages
       * `listener_receiver` -- Asynchronously recieves AMQP messages and turns them into Dripline messages
       * `heartbeater` -- Sends periodic heartbeat messages
       * `scheduler` -- Can schedule events
    
     As is apparent from the above descriptions, a service is responsible for a number of threads 
     when it executes:
       * Listening -- grabs AMQP messages off the channel when they arrive
       * Message-wait -- any incomplete multi-part Dripline message will setup a thread to wait 
       *                 until the message is complete, and then submits it for handling
       * Receiver -- grabs completed Dripline messages and handles it
       * Async endpoint listening -- same as abovefor each asynchronous endpoint
       * Async endpoint message-wait -- same as above for each asynchronous endpoint
       * Async endpoint receiver -- same as above for each asynchronous endpoint
       * Heatbeater -- sends regular heartbeat messages
       * Scheduler -- executes scheduled events

     In addition to receiving messages from the broker, a user or client code can give messages directly to the service 
     using `process_message(message)`.
