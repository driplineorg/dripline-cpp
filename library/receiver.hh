     @author N.S. Oblath

     @brief A receiver is able to collect Dripline message chunks and reassemble them into a complete Dripline message.

     @details
     This is a mix-in class for synchronously receiving and processing Dripline messages.

     Dripline messages can be broken up into multiple chunks, each of which is transported as an AMQP message.  
     A receiver is responsible for handling message chunks, storing incomplete Dripline messages, and eventually 
     processing complete Dripline messages.

     The receiver class contains an interface specifically for users waiting to receive reply messages: `wait_for_reply()`.

     When the first message chunk for a message is received, one of two things happens:
     1. if the message comprises one chunk, then the message is processed immediately;
     2. if the message comprises multiple chunks, then a separate thread is spun up to wait for the remaining chunks.

     Incomplete messages are stored in the incoming-message map.  Message chunks for a given message can be received 
     in any order.  The receiver will wait `single_message_wait_ms` ms for all of the chunks of a message to arrive 
     before timing out processing the incomplete message.

     The actual assembly of message chunks into complete messages is done in @ref message.

     The `receiver` class itself does not know how to process a message.  This must be implemented by the class derived from `receiver`.
     The default implementation of `process_message()` will throw a `dripline_error`.

     @brief Receives and processes messages concurrently

     @details
     This class enables Dripline messages to be received and processed concurrently.  It is intended to be used in 
     conjuction with a listener, as in @ref listener_receiver.

     The typical use case involves three threads:
     1. A listener gets messages from the AMQP channel (using `listen_on_queue(), e.g. @ref service or @ref endpoint_listener_receiver) and 
        calls `receiver::handle_message_chunk()`
     2. A receiver has a timing thread waiting for multiple message chunks (if relevant); 
        when the message is complete, `concurrent_receiver::process_message()` is called, which deposits the message in a concurrent queue.
     3. A concurrent_receiver picks up the complete message from the concurrent queue, and processes the message using `submit_message()`.

     The `execute()` function implements thread 3.

     A class deriving from concurrent_receiver must implement `submit_message()`.
