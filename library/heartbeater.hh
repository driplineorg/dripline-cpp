     @brief Adds heartbeat capabilities: repeatedly sends an alert on a particular time interval

     @details
     This class is intended to be used as a mix-in to add heartbeat capabilities to another class 
     by inheriting from it.  See @ref service as an example of its use.

     The heartbeat is an alert sent to a pre-determined routing key, which is given as a parameter to the 
     `execute()` function.  The interval for sending the heartbeats is `f_heartbeat_interval_s`, 
     which is in seconds.  The default interval is 60 s.

     If the heartbeat interval is 0, the sending of heartbeats is disabled.

     The parameters provided upon execution are the name (`a_name`, e.g. the service name), a UUID (`a_id`), and 
     the routing key (`a_routing_key`).

     The payload of each heartbeat message will be:
     ~~~
     {
         name: [a_name]
         id: [a_id]
     }
     ~~~

     The routing key to which the message will be sent is `a_routing_key.a_name`.
