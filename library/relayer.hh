     @brief Asynchronous message sending

     @details
     This class allows a user to send message asynchronously.  Messages are sent in a dedicated thread that runs 
     the function `execute_relayer()`.  Asynchronous operation is achieved using a concurrent queue to 
     store messages that are submitted.

     The primary user interface consists of `send_async()` and `wait_for_reply`().  The former immediately returns a special 
     sent-message package that includes thread-synchonization objects.  That package is then passed to the latter,
     which blocks while waiting for a reply.
