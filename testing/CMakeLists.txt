# So far it seems sufficient to use Catch2's ability to run tests, and not CTest.
# Here are two ways it could potentially be integrated with CTest, if we change our minds.

# Normal CMake Integration
#enable_testing()
#add_test(NAME test_test COMMAND run_tests )

# Automated CMake Integration
#include(CTest)
#include(Catch)
#catch_discover_tests(foo)
